Test hypotheses for the price of automobiles:

    >  Compare and test Normality the distributions of price and log price – Use both a graphical method and a formal test.

    > Test significance of price (log price) stratified by a) fuel type, b) aspiration, and c) rear vs. front wheel drive. Use both graphical methods and the formal test.

    > Apply ANOVA to the auto price data to compare the price (or log price if closer to a Normal distribution) of autos stratified by number of doors, and body style – two sets of tests.

        - Graphically explore the differences between the price conditioned by the categories of each variable – Hint, make sure you have enough data for each category.

         - Use standard ANOVA and Tukey ANOVA to test the differences of these groups.

You must submit:

- One R-script containing all code required for your analysis. Please include comments so that your code is easy to follow.

- One document discussing and supporting your conclusions, presented in a complete and professional style.
