Assignment 6

Probability of texting.
  – You are asked to compute the probability that the driver of a car is texting at a specific intersection.
  – Nationally the cumulative probability that a driver is texting is:
      > P = 0.5, at x = 0.1
      > P = 0.75 at x = 0.3
  – You observe cars at a location three times and note the number of texting drivers:
2 texting out of 20 drivers
4 texting out of 20 drivers
1 texting out of 20 drivers
> Given these data
   – Compute the Beta prior, and report the coefficients
  – Plot the prior, likelihood and posterior three times as you update your belief based on collecting more data
  – Simulate the final posterior distribution and do the following:
     > Plot the posterior with the 90% HDI shown
      > Report the upper and lower limits of the 90% HDI
      > Of the next hundred drivers what are the number of texting drivers in the 90% HDI?
      > Are the drivers in this area better or worse that the national figures indicate?
